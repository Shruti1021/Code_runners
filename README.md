Codefundo project
 ABSTRACT:-
 
“Our main idea is to make a mobile application which warns the masses about the upcoming danger from the data collected through various sensors installed at various places for different disasters and processed in our cloud computing system. Also prevention and management of disasters is suitably handled through our app.”

PREDICTION

Different sensors are installed for different natural disasters according to the type of disaster prone area.

•	EARTHQUAKE - D7S seismic sensor (in tectonic plates) thermal sensor like SSM/I or NOAA-AVHRR are used.

•	VOLCANO - gas sensors are used.

•	FLOOD, STORM, CYCLONE - detected by the help of local weather forecasting stations.

Data is send through low power Wide area network (loraWAN technology) to the cloud computing system.

PREVENTION

Not much time is left in hand after the prediction of disasters. So as soon as something is predicted,

•	 Notification to user and their local contacts via an alarm and sms system.  

•	To alert people in remote areas messages on radio are sent. The help of news channels and loudspeakers can also be taken.

•	To alert masses immediately, sky signals to be used.

•	Various tutorials to save oneself form different disasters can be accessed.

Details of every person to be present in our data base to help in case of need.
 
MANAGEMENT

Destruction once done can’t be done right again but with proper management things can be made better. Our app aims at helping the masses in the following manner.

•	Display of a small map of the affected regions with help of water level indicators (in case of floods) and GPS system which will help       people in  moving to safer and least affected  places.

•	A direct communication between the people affected and the responsible government officials  so that basic needs can be provided at the     right place effectively. Availability of various helpline nos.

•	“Save me” option  for victims. Their location accessed via GPS will be shared to local people and gov. Official for immediate help.

•	The details of the missing and the dead will be provided. This will save people from running for any help.

•	 Sms system will be available for remote areas. People can communicate via sms which will be suitably read and processed by our system.
